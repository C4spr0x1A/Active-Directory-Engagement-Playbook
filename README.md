# Active Directory Knowledge Base

Obsidian-friendly and GitHub-browsable notes for Active Directory components, enumeration workflows, and OPSEC.

## Quick Start

- Start at: [Master Index](./00_MASTER_INDEX.md)
- Recommended path:
  1) [01_Foundation/Active Directory](./01_Foundation/Active%20Directory.md)
  2) [02_AD Components Index](./02_Active_Directory_Components/00_AD_Components_Index.md)
  3) [03_Enumeration Index](./03_Enumeration_Techniques/00_Enumeration_Index.md)

## Scope

- AD architecture, roles, trusts, schema, sites/subnets
- Enumeration: network → DNS → domain → users → groups → ACLs → advanced
- OPSEC: detection, stealth profiles, production vs. lab guidance
- Tooling: Microsoft-signed cmdlets, native tools, and offensive tools (where appropriate)

## Structure

- 01_Foundation: entry, overview, navigation
- 02_Active_Directory_Components: the theory you need before attacking
- 03_Enumeration_Techniques: practical, command-first workflows
- 04_Security_and_OPSEC: controls, detection, and safe execution guidance
- 05_Tools_and_Techniques: selection and deep-dives
- 06_Lab_Practice: hands-on exercises
- 07_Learning_Resources: objectives and study aids

See the full map in the [Master Index](./00_MASTER_INDEX.md).

## Status

- Core components and enumeration: usable and organized
- Security/OPSEC and some advanced flows: in progress
- Continuous refinements as content expands

## Contributing

- Open an issue with suggested change and rationale
- PRs welcome for fixes, formatting, and new content (keep it concise and actionable)
