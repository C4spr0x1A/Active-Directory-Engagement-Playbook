## Purpose & Definition
Defines objects and their attributes. It defines what types of objects exist in the directory. The schema is **forest-wide** (shared across the entire AD forest) and replicated to every Domain Controller.

## How It Works

### Object Types
- **Objects**: Users, Groups, Computers, Printers, OUs (Organizational Units), etc.

### Attributes
- **Attributes**: `sAMAccountName`, `userPrincipalName`, `memberOf`, `lastLogonTime`, etc. Note that attributes have an **LDAP Display Name** which is commonly seen, and a **Common Name (cn)** which is the actual object name in the directory.

## Administrative Use Cases

### Legit Use (IT/Admins)
- A company integrates a new HR system
- The software extends the schema by adding a new object type like `EmployeeRecord` and attributes such as `employeeID`, `departmentCode`, `jobTitle`
- Now, every user object can store extra HR-related information

### Schema Modification Implications
- Schema modifications are **irreversible** and can have **significant, forest-wide impact**. They must be carefully planned and executed, typically by the Schema Master FSMO role holder.

## Red Team / Attacker Perspective

### Attack Surface
- Attackers query the schema to discover what data is available

### Attack Examples
- Run `ldapsearch` or `Get-ADObject` in PowerShell to enumerate attributes like `servicePrincipalName` (SPN) â†’ used in **Kerberoasting**
- Poorly designed schema extensions may expose sensitive fields (e.g., clear-text info stored in custom attributes)
